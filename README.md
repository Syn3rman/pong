### pong

~~AI plays pong.~~ Clone of pong. Original motivation was to use reinforcement learning to allow the agent to control the paddle to play against a person but I soon realised that this wasn't really the best task suited for it (since a simple algorithm works just fine) and things went downhill from there. The scoring system is thus based keeping the earlier goal in mind and it is also the reason I have not added a menu as of now.

- [X] Make clone of pong
- [X] Make computer play it
